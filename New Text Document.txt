It was also apparent that she followed a different sect within Islam and held beliefs that I found conflicting with my understanding of our faith. For example yk about firka means like there types of muslim like shia, sunni and more but in reality these are not in islam but are made by us, so she was shia and doing shirk like believing in stones that it will change our naseeb or what ever infact there durood pak is different from the original one. I tried numerous times to explain my beliefs, but she couldn't comprehend or accept them. I prayed sincerely for her guidance and enlightenment, hoping she would understand the true essence of Islam and abandon practices that I considered incorrect.

After a lot of contemplation and for the sake of pleasing Allah, I made the difficult decision to distance myself from her. I stopped communicating and even removed her from my social media. I earnestly prayed for her guidance and forgiveness, i asked Allah to give her hidayat and (usse aik sahi raste pe lekr aa , usse aik achi rah dikha) feeling remorseful for my past mistakes. This experience led me to reevaluate my actions and lifestyle, motivating me to become a better Muslim. So Allhumdulilah now i can that i am a muslim i also felt love with Allah to much i also prayed tahajjud for her and now i am on a good track Allah just saved me from the haram, but still i am praying for her , and i am ashamed that what i did in past and also i do repent everyday. And focusing on my goals, and dreams

so the main purpose of telling my whole journey to you All was, i just want an advice and what to do in future. Do i still pray for her and make dua everyday or should i forget her and move on i know Allah's plan are far better than my plan. But still i love her alot and wan't her to be my naseeb, even she's not a good muslim but want Allah make her best and make her mine i really love her.
